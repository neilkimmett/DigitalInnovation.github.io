Digital Innovation was formed 18 months ago by Marks and Spencer to ensure we did not follow in the wake of technological advancement.  We wanted to put together a team which desired not only to create great software but build software which was designed and written right.  A team not driven by the pursuit of profit but driven by the pursuit of greatness.  We believe that it is much easier to make money from a great idea than to try and come up with a great idea to make money, thats why we place creativity at the centre of our development process.  

Working in a true Agile environment our engineers are all multi-lingual and develop in a test first manner, they choose the language they want to work with and live by their decisions.   Quality is central and emphasis is always put on the concept of "Done" as we understand that we can not safely look forward unless we have confidence there is nothing behind us.

One of the main things we are most proud of is our attitude and commitment to open source projects.  For a large corporate we take a sensible approach to intellectual property and realise that contributing to open source initiatives is far beneficial than locking all code up in a big safe and loosing the key somewhere.  For this reason all of our engineers are encouraged to contribute to open source projects and blog about their experiences, quite often 20% time is spent working on such initiatives.  Did I say we only work on projects 4 days a week? We do, the other day is all about personal development, research and cool stuff.

Over the past 18 months we have grown from 1 to 35 engineers and not one of them has ever worked on SAP or some other big corporate system, we have been too busy having fun working on new projects.  One project that we have are currently working on is to replace the current mobile website.  We are going to build this right, modifying the back end application to give the necessary separation so we can independently get on and work in anyway we like for the front end.  The current technology in favour is Google's Angular framework however a couple of years ago I thought Knockout was the best thing in the world so we will keep a pragmatic view on that.  One thing for certain is that we will choose the tool we want to use and the tool we decide is the best for the job.

So why do we want to come to Silicon Milk Roundabout? Well we want to hire people like us, we are just a start up really, however it helps that our VC makes 10 billion a year.
