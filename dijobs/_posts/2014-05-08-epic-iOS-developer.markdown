##Job Description
Interested in creating something really really good, want to work with the latest technologies applying real engineering principles?

As it happens we are doing that, we have just started building the next version of the Marks and Spencer mobile shopping application.  The app is responsible for some serious revenue to us so we are going to do it right.  TDD and Test First all the way if we are going to be agile we need to be really good at defining what is done.

We are looking for someone with exceptional ability, as it says in the title someone Epic, but like not in that TV advert as that would be lame.  We love to code and the right person for this role must share that love. Spend your time hacking code for fun, got a github account full of irrelevant projects then keep reading.

Actually if this is a Friday and you are reading this then stop reading, we don't work on projects on a Friday that's our innovation day.

###About you

####Essential:
* In depth knowledge of iOS up to and including SDK7.1
* Strong TDD and XCTest knowledge
* OCMock
* UI guru
* CI (Teamcity, Jenkins, etc)
* Excellent communication skills
* Strong OO design and programming skills
* Integration of web APIs - REST/JSON/XML
* Track record of successful apps

####Highly desirable:
* BDD
* Cucumber
* Ruby (we use it to help us automate our builds and tests)
* CocoaPods
* Familiar with version control and task tracking systems (we use git & pivotal)
* Experience of working within an Agile environment

###Boring but important stuff
* We will pay you
* You can have a pension if you want one
* The office is quite nice
* Everyone who works here is cool
* You get a 20% company discount
* Season ticket loan but you know you really should cycle

If you have got all this or even better if you have some code to show us, we would love to hear from you.
