##Job Description
Do you want to work with the latest technologies applying real engineering principles?  

We are just about to start building a new mobile web experience for Marks and Spencer and we want to build the foundation for the future so technology matters.  We will most likely be using HTML5, AngularJS and APIs and we need some amazing developers to help us.  However we are open to ideas and helping to define this techstack is part of the role, working with the tech lead you will be responsible for defining and proving that your ideas are the right choices for us.

Performance and Quality are two things very close to our hearts, we we always use a test first methodology because we know that stuff matters.  We also have a pretty nice laid back working environment, doing things right does not mean get it right first time, we know how important it is to experiment and thats why we only work 4 days per week on product work.  The other day is dedicated to innovation and personal development.
